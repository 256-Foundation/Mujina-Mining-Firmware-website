## Open Mining Firmware
Mujina is an [open-source](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) Bitcoin mining firmware built to support a number ASIC chips. 

There are currently no open-source Bitcoin mining firmware options and we're going to change that with this project. Unless you are running your miner in the exact conditions it was engineered for then you have probably experienced the headache of dealing with closed parameters in the firmware that you can't change. There are several aftermarket firmware options available that provide additional flexibility beyond the manufacturers firmware but they are all closed source and still they leave something to be desired when it comes to customizations. Beyond being open-source, the main highlights of the Mujina Mining Firmware are: Linux based, multi driver compatible, and Stratum v2 client support. This will unlock hacks like changing the main supply voltage, swapping out or removing the fans, changing ASIC voltage & frequency, and anything else the end user wants to change.

## Scope
One Project Manager position and one developer position to fulfill the mission of The 256 Foundation, “Dismantle the proprietary mining empire to make Bitcoin and freedom tech accessible to anyone”. This grant proposal aims to secure funding for:

* One project manager to oversee and ensure mission adherence, timeliness, and execution. 
* One developer to build the Mujina Firmware.
* Mujina specifics: Fully open-source Linux-based mining firmware which is compatible with a range of Bitcoin mining hardware drivers like Antminer, Whatsminer, Avalon, and the list can be extended.
* A built-in StratumV2 client.
* User-friendly dashboard.
* Complete client architecture. 
* Supporting documentation and specifications. 
* This project is fully open-source GPL licensed.
* Excluded from this proposal are sales, distribution, marketing, and customer technical support.

The initial release of Mujina is being built in such a way that it supports long-term goals like ultimately evolving into a complete Linux-based operating system, deployable through simple flashing procedures. Initially focused on supporting the 256 Foundation's Libre control boards and Ember hash boards, Mujina's modular architecture will eventually enable compatibility with a wide variety of mining hardware from different manufacturers.

## Timeline:
